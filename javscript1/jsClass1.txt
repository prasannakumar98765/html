Variables: it is used to store the values
variableName: variableName sholud always be in camelCase

Datatypes: what type of the value the variable is going to store

there are two types of Datatypes
1. primitive Datatypes: In primitive data type only one value can be stored


2. nonPrimitive Datatypes (it is also known as composite Datatypes): it is called as collection of values

Primitive Datatypes: 
        1.integer
        2.float
        3.long
        4.double
        5.string
        6.boolean
        7.undefined
        8.null

non primitive datatypes:
        1.array: collection of values stored in  a same variable name or single varaible name
        2.object: collection of values stored in a same object name with different identifier
            syntax: objectName={
                key:value,
                key:value,
            };
        3.function:function is used to perform some action in a program
            syntax: function functionName(){
                 set of code;
            }


the latest version of java script which we are using is ECMA 6:
  from this ECMA 6 version we use template literal

  Keywords for storing values:
        1.var
        2.let 
        3.const

block scope:printing the variable defined inside the block

toString
toUppercase
toLowerCase
