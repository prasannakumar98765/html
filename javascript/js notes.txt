what is function?
it is a set of statements that performs a task 
the statement should be reusable
there are two types of function
1. user defined function 
        it is called as UDF
        it is also known as custom function or user function
        it is created and defined by the user to perform a specific task or a set of task
    syntax: function functionname(){
                set of statement or function definition
    }
    function call: functionname()
2. pre-defined function
    pre-defined functions are functions that are build in already embeded in a program
    Eg: getElementById()

if 

if-else

else-if ladder

nested-if

    logical operators:
    && operator:
    true true = true
    true false =false
    false true =false
    false false= false

    || operator:
    true true = true
    true false =true
    false true =true
    false false= false

    ! operator:
    true =false
     false =true
    

    switchcase:

            switch is used insted of nested if
    syntax: switch()
    {
        case1 val:
                statement
        break;

        default:
